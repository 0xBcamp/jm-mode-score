## Mode Scoring on Mode Protocol ðŸ”® :ringed_planet: :mag:

for Proper explanation on how this application works, See [EXPLANATION](./EXPLANATION.md)

NOTE: Instead of Debank i am usinig Covalent(as they support mode network)

NOTE: All data is being tested on ethereum chain, but design in such a way that it can be switch to mode easily(will need top erc20 tokens on the mode network, and other stuffs )

**Onchain Transaction** model (powered by [Covalent](./images/modescore.drawio.png))

- :acount: account for credits, debits transactions, transfers, frequency, the cumulative balance now, and more
- :chains: fetch up to 100 top ERC20 tokens (by market capitalization) via [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) API
- :bar_chart: analyze time series of latest 400 transactions on wallet
- :investigate: inspect historical OHLCV for last 30 days


## Clone This Project :key: :lock: :package:

### 1. Clone locally

Download or clone the repo to your machine, running in terminal

```bash
git clone  ... my-project-name
cd my-project-name
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Create vitual environment
```bash
python<version> -m venv <virtual-environment-name>              # run in venv
source venv/bin/activate                                        # start venv
```

Run either of the commands below. You'll need either `pip` or `conda` package manager

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt                                 # using pip
conda create --name <env_name> --file requirements.txt          # using Conda
```

### 3. Environment variables

Create a `.env` local file in your root folder. The required credentials are

```bash
PLAID_ENV='sandbox'
DATABASE_URL='postgres_url'
```

### 4. Execute locally

For testing th application use the Swagger API platform. Running the commands below will redirect you to the Swagger, where you'll be able to run _in the backend_ trial mode score calculations

```bash
cd my-project-name
uvicorn main:app â€“-reload
```

> :warning: The app will execute properly, only if you set up a correct and complete `.env` file. <br/>
